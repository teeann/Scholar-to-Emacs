* Scholar-to-Emacs
Web extension to import Google Scholar data into Emacs bibliography systems
* Why?
My research workflow mostly revolves around Emacs. Although there are many Emacs packages that supports managing bibliographic data and PDF documents, none of them (as far as I know) provides an easy way to add research papers from Google Scholar.
* How it works
This web extension adds an /Import into Emacs/ link to each research entry in Google Scholar.
Once clicked, these [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html][org-protocol]] links are opened in Emacs, which will import the Bibtex entries and PDF documents package ...
* Installing
1. Setup Firefox so that it uses Emacs to open =org-protocol= link as described here.
2. Install and set up Emacs package [[https://github.com/teeann/scholar-import][scholar-import]]
3. Enjoy!
