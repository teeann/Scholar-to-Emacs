Web extension to import Google Scholar data into Emacs bibliography systems
[[./docs/demo.jpg]]
** Why?
Although there are many Emacs packages that supports managing bibliographic data and PDF documents, none of them (as far as I know) provides an easy way to add research papers from Google Scholar.
** How it works
This web extension adds an /Import into Emacs/ link to each research entry in Google Scholar.
Once clicked, these [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html][org-protocol]] links are opened in Emacs, which will import the *Bibtex* entries and *PDF* documents through [[https://github.com/teeann/scholar-import][scholar-import]].
It simply appends Bibtex entries into a =.bib= file and download the corresponding PDF files.
** Installing
1. Install this extension via [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scholar-to-emacs/][Firefox Addons site]].
2. Setup Firefox so that it uses Emacs to open =org-protocol= link as described [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html#org8c1fa25][here]].
3. Enable /Show links to import citations into Bibtex/ option in Google Scholar setting.
4. Install and set up Emacs package [[https://github.com/teeann/scholar-import][scholar-import]].
5. (Optional) Install an Emacs bibliography management package (e.g. [[https://github.com/bdarcus/citar][citar]], [[https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex][helm-bibtex]] or [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]]) for better experience.
